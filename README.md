# My CNC mill

This repository contains everything related to the
build of my CNC mill. The mill is driven by LinuxCNC.

## Structure

- `arduino_sketches` - I am not a fan of Arduino,
however it is great tool for simple prototypes.
All source codes for prototypes is here.

- `config` - LinuxCNC configuration and HAL files for
the mill

- `hal_modules` - LinuxCNC HAL modules for my custom
hardware

- `hw_modules` - PCBs & firmware for custom hardware
